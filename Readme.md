HowTo Hack?
============




What is going on?
------------

##### New generation of epic Machine Learning hackaton SkyHacks 2019 starts right now!
 
What should I do?
------------

You have to solve 2 tasks this year:

`Main task`
* Description - **TODO** 
* [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXwT-KbXcG_lZ2O_x_pTV0Kaxxles8Fo/view?usp=sharing)

`Bonus task`
* Description - **TODO** 
* [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16nNJPWtIMeWb9PmYU0E3cjY5iUIkTMtv/view?usp=sharing)

 
How can I win?
------------

You have to make a model using any available technology on your choice, which beats results of another teams! 
> Remember to make repository with your winning solution public until Saturday, 27.10.2019 15.00, so we can accept it. Solutions with private repositories will be skipped!

 
Where can I send results?
------------
Main [Dashboard](https://judge.skygate.io/) with live results.

To send us your solution you have:
1. Register your team.
2. Send validation .csv file in proper format (so our Scorer can accept it) to begin a task.
3. Solve and send us .csv file with your answer, we will validate it, and show a final score for your solution. 

> You can send answers 1 time every 15 minutes.

 
Butâ€¦ my laptop works like calculator, how can I speed up learning my models?
------------
This year we propose to use 3 solutions where you can collaborate with your teammates and make learning process fast and fun using GPU:

* [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#)
* [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
 
Each of these solutions can be empowered by GPU computational resource. 
> Remember to keep your notebooks private! 

 
Additional stuff:
------------

 1. WiFi password - **TODO**
 2. [Discord](https://discord.gg/3sHrTez)
